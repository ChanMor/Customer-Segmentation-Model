# Customer Segmentation Model

This project implements a customer segmentation model based on a financial transaction dataset with over 1,000,000 records. The goal is to identify distinct customer profiles using K-means clustering, dimensionality reduction with PCA, and feature engineering, providing valuable insights for targeted marketing and personalized financial services.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Transformation of dates, handling missing values, and feature engineering (e.g., age, average transaction amount, transaction frequency, and recency).
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) applied for reducing feature space.
- **Clustering**: K-means clustering to segment customers based on transaction behaviors and account balances.
- **Optimal Cluster Identification**: Using the elbow method to determine the best number of clusters.
- **Actionable Insights**: Generate customer segments to optimize marketing strategies and financial services offerings.
